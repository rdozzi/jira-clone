# Jira-Clone (Portfolio MVP)

This is a Jira-style multi-tenant project management application built as a portfolio Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The project focuses on full-stack architecture, data isolation, and core workflow modeling. The project is influenced by Jira and other project/task management applications from my work history in biotech and lab operations but does not aim to provide enterprise-level feature parity with Jira.
